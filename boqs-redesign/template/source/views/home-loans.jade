            h3 Our Banking Package
            p If you want a home loan that offers more, our Banking Package could be the answer. More than just a home loan, the package allows you to manage your finances in one place with the help of a dedicated financial specialist.
            p It combines a home loan with a credit card and an everyday bank account. Whatâ€™s more, you are able to establish up to five separate loan accounts and the Banking Package includes initial valuations to a combined cost of $1 100 under the one annual package fee of $395.
            p The package also includes an optional offset account on variable loans to reduce the interest repayments you make on your mortgage and the convenience of an optional overdraft facility for variable rate loans.
